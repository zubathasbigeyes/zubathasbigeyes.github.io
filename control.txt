Ancient Penguinz Were Giant Waddling Predators

The 57-million-year-old fossil is both fearsome and comical: a long-beaked penguin that stood 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed about 220 pounds.
''It was as tall as a medium-sized man,'' said Gerald Mayr, a paleontologist at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, and lead author of a report in Nature Communications on Tuesday announcing the discovery. 
By comparison, the tallest living species, the emperor penguin, reaches about four feet in height. Kumimanu biceae, as the fossil was named, would have towered above the emperor, and above just about all other known ancient penguins. 
(In 2014, another team of researchers estimated that a 34-million-year-old species stood six feet tall, but they based that estimate only on two bone fragments.)
Kumimanu wasn't just exceptionally big; it also ranks among the oldest penguin fossils yet found. Both its age and its size make Kumimanu important to understanding the astonishing transformation that turned a lineage of flying birds into flightless swimmers.
  The 18 modern species of penguin, ranging from the coast of Antarctica to the Galápagos Islands at the Equator, are impressively adapted to aquatic life. Rigid, blade-shaped wings enable them to shoot through the water at up to 22 miles an hour. Record-setting human swimmers don't even reach six m.p.h.
  But their adaptations to water have also left them unable to fly. When penguins haul out to rest or rear their young, they can only waddle about on stumpy legs. ''They're so unbirdlike that many people would not know they are birds,'' Dr. Mayr said.
  While penguins may look profoundly different from other birds, their DNA points to a close kinship to such species as albatrosses and petrels. These birds all fly over water to hunt for prey, hinting that the ancestors of penguins may have, too.
  Auks, which can dive over a hundred feet underwater, may be a living model of the first penguins.
  Birds accumulate mutations in their DNA at a roughly clocklike rate, allowing scientists to estimate when their lineages branched apart. Studies suggest that penguins diverged around the time of the mass extinction that struck the planet about 66 million years ago.
  A combination of massive volcanic eruptions and an asteroid impact are believed to have been responsible for the global catastrophe. Among the victims were giant marine reptiles and dinosaurs (with the exception of birds, which are feathered dinosaurs). The mass extinctions marked the end of the Mesozoic Era and the beginning of the Cenozoic, which continues today.
  The first penguin fossils were uncovered in 1859, and since then more than 50 species have been identified. The oldest of these, found in New Zealand, date back about 60 million years. Known as Waimanu, the oldest known penguins lived just a few million years after the mass extinctions.
  The new fossil penguin, Kumimanu, was discovered from bones packed in a rock on a New Zealand beach. Realizing that it was almost as old as Waimanu, Dr. Mayr and his colleagues eagerly studied Kumimanu for a better picture of early penguin evolution.
  To see how it was related to other species, the scientists drew an evolutionary tree and found that Kumimanu and Waimanu belonged to its farthest branches. Their lineages have been extinct for tens of millions of years.
  By contrast, all living penguins belong to a young branch of the tree. They share a common ancestor that lived only about 15 million years ago.
  Kumimanu and Waimanu were already flightless, but they still held onto some primitive traits not found in living penguins.
  ''Their beak looked much more like a stork's,'' Dr. Mayr said. ''Probably they speared their prey.''
  The early penguin wing was not yet the short, stiff blade found on living penguins. ''They were probably able to bend it a little farther than penguins can today,'' Dr. Mayr said. ''There was more possibility for flexing.''
  Where Waimanu and Kumimanu differ from each other is in their height. Waimanu stood just two and a half feet high. Kumimanu was more than twice as tall.
  ''We already knew penguins were around, and flightless, just a few million years after the extinction,'' said Daniel T. Ksepka, a paleontologist at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn., who was not involved in the new study. ''The new fossil shows they achieved immense sizes very rapidly as well, which is cool.''
  Dr. Mayr speculates that the dramatic origin of penguins was sparked by the mass extinctions that marked the dawn of the Cenozoic. Suddenly the oceans were emptied of many of their biggest predators. Penguins could adapt to catching prey underwater without much competition, or fear.
  ''It's an educated guess that makes sense, but there's no rock-solid evidence,'' said Dr. Mayr.
  One way to test that hypothesis would be to uncover earlier fossils. ''What would be cool would be to have a flying ancestor of penguins,'' Dr. Mayr said.
  The early Cenozoic oceans didn't just open up the way for the evolution of flightless aquatic birds, Dr. Mayr speculated. It may have also fostered the evolution to big sizes.
  Natural selection favors lightweight flying birds because they have to work so hard to stay aloft. Penguins don't pay that cost. Getting bigger might have brought advantages, as well. A large body makes prey harder to kill.
  The tree drawn by Dr. Mayr and his colleagues also shows that penguins became giants many times over. While Kumimanu belonged to an early lineage of big penguins, other lineages produced their own giants as recently as 27 million years ago.
  The rise of marine mammals may have doomed giant penguins. As mammals moved into the oceans and evolved into whales and seals, they may have outcompeted the birds.
  Both seals and penguins need to find safe beaches where they can mate and raise their young, for example. It's possible that the seals pushed the giant penguins out, while smaller penguins survived.
  ''The big question for me is not why there were so many penguins in the early Cenozoic, but why there are no giant penguins today?'' Dr. Mayr said.

Founding the New England Colonies
Ten years after the Pilgrims first landed at Plymouth, another group left England in search of religious freedom. This group called themselves Puritans. 
Over the next half century, the Puritans played an important role in settling New England. They wanted to practice their religion in their own way, and they didn’t put up with outside opinions. Infighting and power struggles were common. New settlements and even new colonies grew out of the disagreements in their group.
King Charles I issued a charter, or written grant, allowing Puritans to colonize Massachusetts. More than 1,000 Puritans established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. By the mid-1640s, their population had grown to 20,000! In the beginning, only members of their faith were allowed to vote in the colony. They established laws and policies that reflected their religious beliefs.

The Pilgrims were separatists. They wanted to separate completely from the Church of England. The Church of England was headed by the king, and the Pilgrims’ beliefs were seen as treason. Puritans wanted big changes but still considered themselves part of the Church of England.
 John Winthrop, a Puritan leader, was the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. On the way to North America, he gave a sermon. In it he said the Puritans would provide an example of moral living for the rest of the world. He told his listeners the whole world would be watching them.
 
“We shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. . . .”*
— JOHN WINTHROP 
 
*Life and Letters of John Winthrop, 1630–1649, by Robert C. Winthrop. Little, Brown, and Company, 1869.
What do you do when you don’t agree with somebody? The Puritans didn’t want anyone to dissent, or express a different opinion. They forced anyone who disagreed with them to leave the colony. One person they kicked out was Anne Hutchinson, who preached different religious views. Her brother-in-law, John Wheelwright, defended her and was forced out, too. He eventually helped found Exeter, New Hampshire. 
Anne Hutchinson believed strongly in the ideas she preached in Massachusetts. At her trial in Boston, she said, “You condemn me for speaking what in my conscience I know to be truth.”[[*]] She and some of her followers created a settlement in what is now Portsmouth, Rhode Island. They became some of that colony’s earliest founders. Roger Williams was also banished, or forced out, of Massachusetts Bay Colony for his beliefs. He said the government had no right to interfere in religion. He and some of his followers founded Providence, Rhode Island.
*Anne Hutchinson. Anne Hutchinson, Guilty or Not? A Closer Look at Her Trials by Jean Cameron. Peter Lang Publishing, 1994.
Areas near Portsmouth had been settled in 1623 by a group of fishermen under David Thomson. They built a fort and other settlement buildings. They named the settlement Pannaway Plantation. Later, Portsmouth combined with other settlements to make the New Hampshire Colony.
 After Hutchinson was forced out of Massachusetts, others decided to leave, too. Thomas Hooker and John Haynes left Massachusetts and formed the Connecticut Colony. Hooker is called “the Father of Connecticut.” Both Hooker and Haynes helped develop the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. This document was based on a sermon Hooker gave in 1638. The Orders were one of the earliest constitutional documents in the colonies.


Civil Rights
Summer is finally here! It’s 1961, and your big brother is home from college. But he’s going to Mississippi to join a group called the Freedom Riders.
He explains that black and white people have been riding buses together to fight discrimination against African Americans. Discrimination is unfair treatment of people because of their race, gender, religion, or nationality.
More and more African Americans in the 1950s had stood up to this unfair treatment. They tried to end segregation, the separation of blacks and whites in public places like restaurants. The Freedom Riders and other groups objected to segregation laws by using nonviolence, or peaceful protests. But they were still attacked sometimes by people who disagreed with them. Martin Luther King Jr. became a leader of the civil rights movement. He gave speeches and led peaceful marches. In 1963, about 250,000 people came to the nation’s capital for the March on Washington. There, King spoke about his dream of the future. He saw a world where people wouldn’t be judged by their skin color.
In 1951, Linda Brown had playmates of different races in her hometown of Topeka, Kansas. She thought she would go to school with all of them. But state law made African Americans attend separate schools. The case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka went all the way to the Supreme Court. There, a lawyer named Thurgood Marshall argued for integration in public schools. Integration means bringing together people of all races. In 1954, the court ruled that schools had to desegregate. They had to let kids of all races attend classes together.
In 1955, Rosa Parks took a seat in the middle of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. State law said African Americans had to sit in back. When the driver told her to give her seat to a white man, she refused—and was arrested. Afterward, Martin Luther King Jr. led the Montgomery Bus Boycott. For months, black people would not ride city buses. In 1956, the Supreme Court ruled that public transportation could not be segregated.
 In 1964, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. President Johnson signed it in a ceremony shown on TV. This law made segregation illegal in public places. It also said employers couldn’t refuse to hire people because of their race, gender, nationality, or religion. But even after the law passed, African Americans were still treated unfairly.
African Americans were kept from voting in some states, especially in the South. Martin Luther King Jr. tried to change that in 1965 by leading peaceful marches in Selma, Alabama. The marchers were attacked by state police and others who disagreed with them. The violence was shown on TV. Many people around the nation were upset by it. Later that year, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. By 1968, more than half of all African Americans who were old enough had registered to vote.
Many groups fought for their rights during the 1960s. Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta started a group that became the United Farm Workers of America. It tries to improve conditions for farm laborers. Women fought for equal pay and equal rights. Formed in 1966, the National Organization for Women became a political force for women’s rights. In 1968, the American Indian Movement (AIM) was founded to help make life better for Native Americans.
The President’s Home
· 750L - 890L 
The city of Washington, D.C., was created to be the center of the national government. A special home, now called the White House, was built for the president at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. George Washington chose the spot and approved the plans. But he never lived there. 
The capital city of the U.S. during his presidency was first New York and then Philadelphia. When the second president, John Adams, moved into the presidential home in 1800, it was still under construction. Since then, the building has been remodeled, added to, and redecorated many times.
How did Washington, D.C., become the nation’s capital? The decision to build it there was worked out at a dinner between James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson. Madison agreed to let the federal government take on the debt carried by the states. In return, Hamilton agreed to place the new capital in the South.
During the War of 1812, the British attacked Washington. They burned the building where the president lived. At the time, the building was known by various names. These included the President’s Palace, the Presidential Mansion, the President’s House, and even the White House. Before the British arrived, Dolley Madison, wife of President James Madison, took action. She packed up White House valuables, including a famous portrait of George Washington, and got them out of the city. After the British were defeated, the house had to be rebuilt. It was repainted white to cover the burn marks. President Theodore Roosevelt made the White House the building’s official name by printing it on his stationery.
 In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt oversaw construction of the West Wing of the White House. It contains offices for senior members of the Executive Office. It also contains offices for their support staff. The Oval Office (left), the president’s office, is in the West Wing.
The second and third floors of the White House contain private living quarters for the president’s family. There are bedrooms, kitchens, sitting rooms, a sun room, and a game room. The private quarters also include guest bedrooms. The most famous one is known as the Lincoln Bedroom (right). The room was actually used as an office by Abraham Lincoln. It is now contains a bed that his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, purchased. The bed measures almost six feet by eight feet. 
The ground floor and first floor of the White House contain rooms for ceremonies. They are also used for official entertaining. They include the Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, and East Room. John Adams’s wife, Abigail, once had sheets hung up to dry in the East Room.
The first lady is the unofficial title of the hostess of the White House. A hostess is someone who oversees social gatherings. Most often the first lady has been the president’s wife. But if the president is a widower or bachelor, a relative or close friend can be the first lady. Some first ladies have taken an active role in politics. Eleanor Roosevelt, for example, wrote newspaper articles and held press conferences. She traveled the country to promote her husband’s New Deal programs. She also supported equal treatment for women and people of all races. Other first ladies have supported less political causes. First Lady Michelle Obama developed a youth fitness program called Let’s Move! Her goal is to help end childhood obesity.
Children in the White House
Some presidents have had young children who lived in the White House. In 1893, Esther Cleveland, the second child of Grover Cleveland, became the only child of a president to be born there. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest person to become president. He brought six children to the White House, ranging in age from 3 to 17. They were always getting up to something. The nation followed their adventures with great interest. In 1971, Tricia Nixon became the last president’s child to be married in the White House. 
Snowy Owls - Stealthy Hunters
How these birds of prey keep on the move to survive in cold climates
The winter wind blows across the open landscape. Short grasses and bushes struggle to stay upright, but a snowy owl hovers effortlessly in midair a few feet off the ground. His powerful, five-foot-long wingspan defies the wind, allowing him to hang nearly motionless with his eyes fixed on a small rodent. Then the owl shoots forward and extends his sharp talons to grab a rat when, whoosh! Airplane engines blast overhead, breaking the owl's concentration and scaring the rat back underground.
The young male owl began life in the Arctic about five months ago. This winter he flew hundreds of miles south to Logan International Airport near Boston, Massachusetts. Perched on a fence at the airport border, he turns his head upside down to preen, cleaning his downy coat. His white feathers are tipped with brown stripes. When he's mature, he'll be almost all white.
He hears something, spins his head to look behind him, and launches. Like a stealth plane, he glides silently for two miles until his keen eyes find his target at the water's edge. He maneuvers gracefully, stretches out his talons, and snatches an unsuspecting duck. Sensitive feet tell him that he killed it on impact. Dinner is served.
Raptors on the Move
Snowy owls are nomads that migrate to and from their Arctic breeding grounds each spring and fall in a quest for food. Logan Airport is a popular winter destination for them in the northeastern United States. "The habitat here is like the tundra--with short grass and rolling hills," says Norman Smith, a raptor biologist and director of the Blue Hills Trailside Museum in Milton, Massachusetts. "There are lots of rodents, and the airport is surrounded by water so there are ducks and other waterfowl."
Snowy owls show up at the airport between November and April each year. Smith has caught and released about 450 owls at Logan since 1981. He captures the birds in a net trap, examines them, and puts a metal band on one leg for future identification. Then he releases them away from airplane and car traffic. Sometimes he equips an owl with an electronic beacon so he can track where the bird goes. The beacons help researchers uncover information about where snowy owls travel when they're not nesting on the Arctic tundra.
Wintering on Ice
Not all snowy owls migrate so far south. Some stay in the Arctic, hunt there, and--like one lone female snowy owl--endure the winter in constant darkness. The sun never rises in winter this far north. Sea ice covers the landscape, and this owl is a hundred miles from land. Temperatures can plummet to minus 40°F, but she's not turning into a bird-side. Layers of feathers insulate her, and feathers cover her nostrils and feet, which are padded for warmth. Her two-foot-tall body is motion-less as she conserves energy in the cold. She's hungry; she needs to eat.
A short flight takes the owl to open water, where she swoops down and grabs an eider, a northern sea duck. She tears it apart with her beak, unaware that she is being monitored. When she was nesting last summer, researchers fit her with a birdsize backpack beacon. It sends out a signal with her precise location via satellite every five days.
Researchers used to think snowy owls always flew south in the winter, but this bird's transmitter has tracked her to the sea ice near Baffin Island in the Canadian high Arctic. "It was a big surprise for us to see them staying north," says Gilles Gauthier, a professor at Canada's Laval University. "Most of the snowy owls we tracked spent one to three months on the ice." Gauthier says gaps in the ice are where seabirds gather, so hunting is good for a snowy owl.
Tundra Life
As the springtime sea ice thaws, the solitary female snowy owl migrates overland to find a good nesting site. She lands on the tundra near Barrow, Alaska, satisfied that there is a good supply of lemmings. These rodents are the summertime staple of snowy owls. Lots of lemmings mean plenty of food, so snowy owls will lay many eggs.
~~~~~~~~
By May, the female sits atop a raised mound in the treeless tundra on a nest of eight eggs, keeping them warm. One by one, fuzzy owlets hatch in mid-June. They snuggle under their mother's wings and against the featherless brood patch on her belly to keep warm in the 40°F weather. Hunting constantly, their father provides food for the whole family. The chicks grow quickly, each eating about two lemmings a day.
Today the male returns to find the female pretending to be injured, trying to lure away snowy owl researcher Denver Holt, who is examining and banding the chicks. The parents think he is a predator. Hooting, the airborne male drops the lemming he's carrying, which hits Holt on the head. The owl then rakes his sharp talons on Holt's back. The assault continues until Holt leaves. Then the angry birds quickly return to being doting parents. "It's pretty intense, but you learn to deal with it and duck," Holt says.
When the owlets are about two months old, their fluffy, gray down gives way to white-and-brown feathers. They're learning to fly. By October, all of the chicks are ready to strike out on their own. Silently, they glide into the darkness to their winter destinations.
BETTER LEFT IN THE WILD
On screen, Harry Potter's snowy owl, Hedwig, made a good companion. In real life, snowy owls are not good pets. Besides needing a constant supply of whole rodents to eat, these hunters require lots of flying space. Experts sometimes have permits to keep injured birds in captivity if they'd be unable to survive in the wild. Otherwise, it's illegal to keep snowy owls in captivity.

The nuclear nightmare that kept life simple; Stark choices made decision-making easy in the Cold War, says Gerard DeGroot

In 1962 the US formulated a Single Integrated Operational Plan for fullscale nuclear war. Devoid of subtlety, its aim was to obliterate communism. Included among the targets was tiny Albania, despite it not being a Soviet ally. "I hope you don't have any friends or relations in Albania," Tommy Power, the head of the Strategic Air Command, told the defence secretary Robert McNamara, "because we're just going to have to wipe it out." 
The plan to obliterate Albania reveals the simplistic nature of Cold War allegiances. As Americans saw it, Albania was communist, communism was bad, therefore Albania would be destroyed. Identifying friends and enemies was easy in a world of rigid bipolarity. As Odd Arne Westad argues, the Cold War was an international system, but less complicated than those built by Bismarck or Metternich. Its simplicity buttressed its stability. The absence of doubt streamlined decisionmaking and kept the peace for 50 years. Westad argues that "the Cold War was born from the global transformations of the late 19th century". In other words, the bipolarity of the Cold War was already apparent in 1917. During the First World War there emerged two "supercharged empires", the US and the USSR, and it "sharpened the divide between capitalism and its critics". Many of the giants of the early Cold War - Stalin, Truman, Adenauer, Eisenhower, Attlee, Ho Chi Minh - were formed by their experiences during the Great War.
That argument is not particularly contentious, but it does encourage a sense of inevitability: the idea that rivalries were set in stone long before 1945. While this is true, decisions made later rendered the conflict more acrimonious than it perhaps needed to be. For instance, Truman, devoid of foreign policy experience, did not handle the American atomic monopoly particularly well between 1945 and 1949. Westad virtually ignores this issue, thus implying that it was not important. Yet Truman saw the Bomb as a "master card" with which he could reshape the world. In 1948 the British physicist Patrick Blackett rightly argued that the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was "not so much the last military act of the Second World War as the first major operation of the cold diplomatic war with Russia".
In this book the Cold War emerges as a Leviathan beyond human control. Westad points out that neither the US nor the Soviet Union had steadfast plans for postwar Europe; the force of circumstance instead shaped the east-west divide. Widespread devastation made European countries look for outside assistance, with little consideration to consequence. Beggars can't be choosers. For instance, the Dutch, existing in 1945 on 900 calories a day, welcomed American largesse regardless of the strings attached. Farther east, the Poles, while no lovers of Russia, found their options similarly restricted.
Bipolarity, because of its simplicity, left little room for grand diplomacy. When issues of hegemony arose, the simple solution was to cut countries in half. Thus Germany, Korea and Vietnam were split along arbitrary lines with little attention to logic or justice. The Americans and Soviets were for the most part comfortable with partition. When the Soviets began building the Berlin Wall, John Kennedy remarked that "it's not a very nice solution, but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war".
Circumstance was a cruel tyrant.
Leaders on both sides tended to accept iniquity without protest. Morality proved inconvenient and irrelevant. When the Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin visited the White House to tell Lyndon Johnson that the Soviet Union had invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, the president simply shrugged and offered his guest a mint julep. After 1975 the Americans knew that Pol Pot was a genocidal tyrant, but they supported him anyway because he was fighting the Vietnamese.
The apparent lack of options encouraged a careless acceptance of fate. Making decisions seemed easy. The Americans saw no alternative but to intervene in Vietnam, the Soviets likewise perceived only one road in Afghanistan. For the US, supporting right-wing military dictatorships in Latin America made political sense, even if it was economically disastrous.
Both sides adhered to the perverted logic that my enemy's enemy is my friend. Thus the Americans gave Stinger missiles to the Afghan mujahidin to help them to fight Russians in the early 1980s. Two decades later the Taliban fired the leftover missiles back at the Americans. Gorbachev warned Reagan about the dangers of courting Islamic fundamentalists, but Reagan couldn't see beyond the immediate certainties of fighting communists. The Cold War came to an end because of great forces, not great men. Globalisation eroded that rigid bipolarity. In Moscow, Budapest and Berlin the people wanted consumer goods even more than they wanted political reform. It is not fanciful to suggest that Levi's, Coca-Cola and McDonald's defeated the Warsaw Pact.
Americans, however, have tended to celebrate a heroic victory, engineered in large part by Reagan. Pride has encouraged a lack of introspection. Americans are still burdened with the belief that they can reshape the world and that absolute security is attainable through military might. That old absence of doubt that characterised Cold War thinking survives, inhibiting adjustment to a much more complicated world. The Americans might have won the Cold War, but in away they were also defeated by it.
Westad, a Harvard University historian, has demonstrated that it is possible to tell the vast story of the Cold War in just 600 pages. This book is short on revelation, but is a clear and well-written summary of a global conflict. Yet the author's task is made easier by his focus on simplicity and inevitability, which vindicates his tendency to discount individual agency. The only leader who emerges as a shaper of the Cold War is, ironically, Nixon, whose vision of détente was unfortunately destroyed by Watergate.
While a Cold War stripped of human agency does perhaps offer a clearer picture of those years, it's the people who make this subject fascinating. The Cold War was packed with glorious futility and tiny heroic gestures. This is an impressive book, but I missed Yuri Gagarin, Neil Armstrong, Bobby Fischer, Olga Korbut, Charlie Wilson and the Miracle on Ice.
I also missed Glenn Cowan, who, by accidentally getting on the Chinese bus at the World Table Tennis Championships in 1971, paved the way for Nixon's visit to China. And I especially missed old Bert the turtle, the public information cartoon character that, by encouraging me to "duck and cover" under my school desk, drove home those simplistic verities about evil Russians out to kill me.

Mission to MARS
Your guide to living on the red planet.
Congratulations! It's the year 2035, and you've been selected to join NASA's newest astronaut class. Your assignment: Travel to Mars. Your crew will be the first humans to set foot on the red planet. We're sure you have questions. And we have answers. Here's your guide to everything you need to know about surviving life on Mars. HOW DO I GET THERE? 
The modern rockets that travel to the International Space Station aren't powerful enough to make it 140 million miles to Mars. So NASA is developing a new spacecraft called Orion. Orion will be the fastest man-made object ever to blast through Earth's atmosphere, reaching a screaming 25,000 miles an hour.
At 16 feet across, the craft is about the size of a van. If that sounds cramped, don't worry: Scientists are investigating the possibility of hooking up Orion to a much bigger ship in space after it's launched from Earth. This ship doesn't exist yet; it's just one idea scientists have for a roomier, more comfortable trip to Mars.
WHAT DO I WEAR? 
"On Mars, your space suit will be the only barrier between you and sudden death," says Brad Holschuh, a professor at the University of Minnesota. Besides supplying you with oxygen and keeping you warm during Mars's below-freezing nights, your space suit protects you from the planet's low pressure. Without the suit, that pressure would cause you to lose consciousness and quickly die.
Current space suits are like gas-filled balloons that push against the body at the correct pressure. But the suits are hard to move in--astronauts fall down a lot. So Holschuh is part of a team that worked on a new flexible space suit called the BioSuit. Astronauts press a button that sends a current through the BioSuit, which adjusts the suit's smart material to the correct pressure.
WHAT DO I EAT? 
Today's freeze-dried astronaut food is nutritious--but definitely not tasty. "Astronauts use a lot of hot sauce!" says Trent Smith j of NASA's VEGGIE project, I which hopes to amp up ! astronauts' meals of prepackaged mush with fruits and vegetables grown in space.
But if an astronaut tried to water crops in zero gravity, the water would just float away. So when the VEGGIE scientists launched their galactic garden to the International Space Station in 2014, they packed lettuce seeds inside pillows filled with fertilizer and a special kind of dirt. Astronauts placed the pillows under LED lights and regularly injected them with water, which stuck to the dirt, where the growing plants could slurp it up. One month later, the crew harvested the first space salad. Mars astronauts could use this technology to grow food in their spacecraft on the way to the red planet. Later, they may farm crops in a Mars greenhouse.
HOW DO I GO TO THE BATHROOM? 
Mars is drier than Earth's driest desert. So all gadgets on your space base will be designed to conserve every drop of water--even from the toilets! The Blue Diversion toilets are currently being developed for use in countries where water is scarce, but similar technology will likely be used on the red planet too. The toilets recycle water, meaning after you've gone to the bathroom, the same water from the bowl goes to the sink for you to wash your hands. Sound gross? The toilet water is first pumped through a filtration system, making it clean enough to drink.
WHAT IF SOMETHING BREAKS? 
"When a lightbulb goes out on Earth, you go to the store for a new one," NASA planetary scientist Chris McKay says. But on Mars, the store is millions of miles away. Today's astronauts bring backup parts, but that takes up valuable space. Soon astronauts will use 3-D printers--which work by layering materials to build an object--to print out whatever they need.
WHAT IF I GET SICK? 
On Mars the nearest doctor is an eight-month flight away. Good thing you'll have a digital doc built right into your space suit. Vitaliti is a medical monitor prototype being developed for future use. With a piece that wraps around your neck and another that rests in your ear, it tracks your vital signs, including your temperature and heart rate. When it picks up signals that you're getting sick,it alerts you, diagnoses your illness, and then recommends the right medicine.
HOW DO I GET AROUND? 
You'll need to leave your base to explore the red planet. That means taking road trips that could last weeks. But the last space vehicle that could carry humans, the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle from the 1970s, was a day-tripping buggy with space for two astronauts but no long-term supplies. Enter Chariot.
"Chariot is kind of like a space RV," NASA robotics engineer Bill Bluethmann says. Behind its cockpit, the vehicle has storage space for scientific equipment, benches for sleeping, a bathroom, and even a small kitchen.
HOW DO I TALK TO PEOPLE BACK HOME? 
When Curiosity--a rover on Mars that's like a science lab on wheels--wants to talk to Earth, it beams radio waves to one of Earth's three deep-space antennas. But the rover sends about 20 photos a day, and communication is limited to text messages." When you're on Mars and you want to talk to your family back on Earth, texts won't cut it," NASA robotics engineer Chaz Morantz says. Scientists hope to speed up communications by using lasers to beam data between Mars and Earth up to a hundred times faster. Mars astronauts will be able to send unlimited snaps of Martian sunsets, selfies, and even video messages.
YOUR ROBOT SIDEKICKS 
Not all jobs are fit for human astronauts. "Anything dull, dirty, or dangerous--those are tasks for robots," NASA robotics engineer Maria Bualat says. Meet four astrobots in development.
LEMUR 
Towering cliffs cover Mars's landscape. LEMUR, a robot with claw-studded arms inspired by insect limbs, can safely scale dangerous rock faces. It will use a camera to get an upclose look at the planet's landmarks and a zero-gravity drill to take samples.
ASTROBEE 
This beach-ball-size flying bot will zoom inside your spacecraft on the journey to Mars. Astrobee will measure the air to make sure the astronauts have enough oxygen, check the spacecraft's parts, and film astronauts as they work so experts watching from Earth can offer advice.
ROBONAUT 
When there's important science to do, you won't waste your time fixing broken equipment. That's a job for Robonaut. This person-shaped bot will be intelligent enough to carry out tasks without a human supervisor.
RASSOR 
Hiding in Mars's dirt are tiny particles of ice. That ice is made of oxygen and hydrogen--ingredients needed for rocket fuel. RASSOR will spin its barrel-shaped shovels to dig up dirt before carrying i t back to camp for processing.
WHAT (NOT) TO PACK

How Many Turns for the Tern?
The world's migration champ sets a new distance record.
Dr. Carsten Egevang gently attaches a small plastic ring to the leg of an Arctic tern. The bird kicks in resistance, but Dr. Egevang's assistant keeps it from escaping. When the two researchers are done, they release the bird, and it flaps to safety with the anklet securely wrapped around its leg.
Dr. Egevang is an ornithologist, a scientist who studies birds. Many other ornithologists use leg bands to identify birds, but Dr. Egevang's leg bands are different. They have tiny electronic devices called geolocators (geo means "earth") attached to them. The geolocators, or "loggers," will help Dr. Egevang learn where the terns go when they migrate.
How Far Do They Go?
Scientists have known for at least 50 years that Arctic terns migrate farther than any other animal. They breed far to the north, in the Arctic. Most of them breed in large colonies in Iceland and Greenland. Like many other birds, they head south when winter approaches.
Most migrating birds spend the winter near the equator, where temperatures stay warm and the birds can find plenty of food to eat. But not Arctic terns. These birds fly right over the tropics, all the way to Antarctica-9,000 miles away! (If you flew from San Francisco to New York City, you would fly about 2,500 miles.)
Arctic terns spend several months in the Antarctic summer before they fly back to the Arctic to breed. That means they migrate 18,000 miles each year, at the very least! But they are not likely to fly in straight paths. How far do they actually fly?
Flight Tracking
For many years, scientists thought Arctic terns flew about 25,000 miles a year, which is equal to a trip around the planet. That estimate included migration plus flying around in the breeding and wintering grounds. But no one knew for sure. What route did they follow? Where did they stop along the way?
Dr. Egevang wanted to find out, and he knew the loggers could help. He bought 50 loggers and attached them to plastic rings. Then he caught 50 Arctic terns at their breeding colonies, fitted each one with a logger, and let them go. As the birds flew, the loggers tracked their locations.
But first Dr. Egevang had a long wait. The recorders used in some animal studies send data to a computer while the animals are traveling. These devices tend to be heavy, since they have to contain fairly big batteries and radio transmitters. But loggers do not. They must be light enough for a small bird to carry as it flies. That meant that Dr. Egevang had to remove the loggers from the birds to retrieve the data.
Here, Birdie!
One year later, Dr. Egevang returned to the breeding colony to catch the birds again. If he didn't find the loggers, he wouldn't get the data. "I worked in a colony of approximately 2,000 terns, and it was very challenging to spot the small logger attached to the leg of the bird. After spotting the bird in the air, we had to find the nest in order to catch it."
When they found the right nest, they put a trap over it. The trap was a small wire cage propped up at one end by a stick. When the bird returned to the nest and settled on the eggs, it also sat on a string that pulled out the stick, trapping the bird under the cage.
But the birds had been caught once before, and it wasn't always easy to trap them again. Some had gone elsewhere to breed, others did not breed the second year, and still others were too sneaky to be caught. Out of 50 banded birds, only 11 were caught a second time.
Record-Setting Migration
Those 11 loggers held a lot of information. Dr. Egevang was amazed by the results. Some birds had flown 50,000 miles in a single year!
Dr. Egevang also solved the mystery of the migration routes. Arctic terns fly over the oceans, following the winds to reduce the effort of flying hundreds of miles a day. And the birds take longer to fly south than they do to fly north. This is probably because they stop to feed for nearly a month in the North Atlantic Ocean in early autumn.
Thanks to Dr. Egevang's research, the Arctic tern holds the record for the longest migration on Earth.

Life on MARS
Pack your bags, and don't forget the spacesuit--you're moving to Mars! NASA wants to send astronauts to Mars by the 2030s. Scientists would live here while exploring the planet and finding resources to use back on Earth. And you could be one of these planetary pioneers. "Unlike Earth, Mars doesn't have oxygen, water, or food," says NASA scientist Chris McKay. "So we'll have to get creative to survive." Here's where you might work, sleep, and hang out as a red planet resident.
HOME Base 
As your spaceship enters Mars's atmosphere, a pod at the front detaches, springs a parachute, and floats to the ground with your team inside. The 1,000-square-foot gumdrop-shaped pod will be part of your Martian home. You expand the home by going outside, blowing up a 150-foot-long inflatable tube with an air pump, and attaching it to the pod. Your new red planet residence guards you from Mars's cold temperatures (it's minus 80°F on average!) and dust storms.
SWEET Digs 
Composed of the pod and the inflatable tube, your Martian home boasts showers, a kitchen, a living room, a gym, TVs, and even Internet access. The pod from your spaceship becomes a huge closet where you hang your spacesuits.
Mars's atmosphere is 95 percent carbon dioxide. So your team must pump oxygen into your new pad through tanks and hoses. Solar panels generate the energy that powers your home, and an underground electric heater produces warmth for the dwelling. You sleep in a bunker that's extra toasty because of its location next to the heater.
OUT and About 
The next groups of colonists set up their homes next to yours to form a tiny community on Mars's vast, rocky landscape. Astronauts work together to inflate enclosed walkways that connect the dwellings. You reinforce the walkways with bricks made of Martian dirt. Now you can move between dwellings without wearing a spacesuit.
When you want to explore your new home planet you hop into a rover. The size of campers, these vehicles are roomy enough for you and another passenger to live in during long explorations.
WORK Space 
Colonists construct a brick building that houses science lab. Here geologists analyze soil to hunt for traces of elements that can be used back on Earth as fuel or material for products. Another building is used as a rover repair center where people can take broken-down vehicles to be fixed.
THIRST Quencher 
At some point the water sent from Earth will run out. Luckily you have a high-tech recycling system that cleans used water. The machine takes sweat and, urn, other liquids your body produces and turns them into drinking water.
MARS Menu 
The air on Mars is deadly for humans. But plants can tolerate a much higher level of carbon dioxide than we can. A greenhouse built by your team protects plants from the frigid temperatures and violent dust storms while they soak up some sun. Inside, Martian farmers grow fruits and vegetables to eat. A system of tanks holds fish brought over from Earth too.
GETTING THERE 
IT'S THE YEAR 2030, but your journey to the red planet started long before liftoff. You trained for the mission for several years. During this time you learned mechanical skills so you can fix broken equipment as well as first aid techniques in case someone gets hurt or sick. Traveling to Mars takes a while too. The 140-million-mile voyage lasts for six to nine months.
WHO WANTS TO BE A MARTIAN? 
A company called Mars One wants to send 24 people to live on the red planet starting in 2026. Many experts doubt Mars One has the technology to get their plans off the ground. But that hasn't stopped people from trying to score a spot on the expedition. Over 4,000 people reportedly applied to join the mission. The one hundred most qualified candidates will be trained in a model Mars colony. They'll have to do tasks such as building Martian dwellings. Those who perform the best will be selected for the Mars One team.


Dressed for the weather
How changing color helps some Arctic animals survive
You probably dress differently in winter and summer, Some animals do, too. Arctic foxes and a few other creatures that are dark in the summertime put on coats of white for an entire winter season. This color change in fur or feathers is for camouflage--a, white coat conceals both predators and prey in their snowy environment.
foxy FOOD CHAIN
When is color camouflage doubly important? When you exist as both predator and prey. The coat of an arctic fox changes to white in winter, allowing it to sneak up on lemmings, hares, and birds. But when it gets very cold and windy, it becomes more difficult for foxes to find a meal on their own. They often tag along behind a polar bear. hoping to feed on whatever the beat doesn't eat. This survival strategy can be risky. Polar bears eat foxes when they can get their paws on them. Being able to blend into the light, snowy background helps an arctic fox hide.
DEPENDENT ON DAYLIGHT
Foxes change from brown fur to white when the season changes from fall to winter, and days become shorter. Decreasing daylight triggers these Arctic animals' bodies to make less of the pigment melanin. Melanin is the substance inside hair OF feathers that gives them colon Once a fox stops producing much melanin, its whole coat is a dazzling white. In the spring the reverse happens. "As the days get longer, more melanin is produced and animals convert back to brown," says researcher Terri-Lee Reid.
An all-white look might work wonders in the middle of winter. But what about when the snow starts to melt in spring, leaving large spots of muddy ground all around? This is where a patchy color scheme comes in handy. Snowshoe hares are well known for this kind of camouflage. Their winter hair grows in patches, rather than showing up evenly. This adaptation makes it difficult for predators to distinguish them from a landscape that also looks both brown and white. "In most species that turn color it takes two months for the coat to change, whether it is turning white in the fall or brown in the spring," says biologist Frank Mallory.
Collared lemmings are the only rodents with coats that change to a white color. They have another interesting adaptation to winter. As snow starts to fall, lemmings grow oversize claws on the third and fourth toes of their front feet. This allows them to dig tunnels in the snow all winter. Staying below the surface helps them avoid predators while they shovel in search of food. By spring, their intense burrowing wears down their claws to a normal size again. The arctic fox, snowshoe hare, and ptarmigan also have a winter foot adaptation: They develop extra fur or feathers on their feet that act as snow shoes. This keeps them from falling through the snow as they move around.
The ptarmigan (TAR-mih-guhn) is a bird with feathers that change from brown to white, providing camouflage in the snow. Feathers on their legs and feet help keep the birds warm. Downy feathers close to their skin trap body heat. Just as insulation in a house keeps warm air inside during winter, this bird's natural insulation makes freezing conditions more bearable. The birds also fly into banks of powdery snow, creating little burrows that are warmer than outside temperatures.
Some animals don't turn completely white, even in the heart of winter. The ermine is one of them. This weasel wears black on the very tip of its tail year-round. Why? This black blotch is a valuable decoy during attacks by flying predators. Studies have shown that hungry hawks have a harder time catching an ermine with a black tip on its tail than they do seizing a weasel that is completely white. When hawks swoop down to attack, the black tip confuses them. They see the ermine moving one way, and its tail flailing about behind it in other directions. This blur of motion can cause a hawk to miss the ermine entirely. Even when a hawk makes a more successful strike, it often grasps the ermine's tail rather than its body. That gives the ermine a fighting chance to squirm away.
