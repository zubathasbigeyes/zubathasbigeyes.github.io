ANCIENT PENGUINS WERE GIANT WADDLING PREDATORS
.
.
The 57-million-year-old fossil is both fearsome and comical: a long-beaked penguin
that stood 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed about 220 pounds.
''It was as tall as a medium-sized man,'' said Gerald Mayr, a paleontologist at 
the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, and lead author of a 
report in Nature Communications on Tuesday announcing the discovery. 
.
By comparison, the tallest living species, the emperor penguin, reaches about 
four feet in height. Kumimanu biceae, as the fossil was named, would have towered 
above the emperor, and above just about all other known ancient penguins. (In 
2014, another team of researchers estimated that a 34-million-year-old species 
stood six feet tall, but they based that estimate only on two bone fragments.)
.
Kumimanu wasn't just exceptionally big; it also ranks among the oldest penguin 
fossils yet found. Both its age and its size make Kumimanu important to 
understanding the astonishing transformation that turned a lineage of flying birds
into flightless swimmers. The 18 modern species of penguin, ranging from the 
coast of Antarctica to the Galápagos Islands at the Equator, are impressively 
adapted to aquatic life. Rigid, blade-shaped wings enable them to shoot through
the water at up to 22 miles an hour. Record-setting human swimmers don't even 
reach six m.p.h.
.
But their adaptations to water have also left them unable to fly. When penguins 
haul out to rest or rear their young, they can only waddle about on stumpy legs. 
''They're so unbirdlike that many people would not know they are birds,'' 
Dr. Mayr said. While penguins may look profoundly different from other birds, 
their DNA points to a close kinship to such species as albatrosses and petrels. 
These birds all fly over water to hunt for prey, hinting that the ancestors of 
penguins may have, too.
.
Auks, which can dive over a hundred feet underwater, may be a living model of the 
first penguins. Birds accumulate mutations in their DNA at a roughly clocklike 
rate, allowing scientists to estimate when their lineages branched apart. Studies 
suggest that penguins diverged around the time of the mass extinction that struck 
the planet about 66 million years ago. A combination of massive volcanic eruptions
and an asteroid impact are believed to have been responsible for the global 
catastrophe. Among the victims were giant marine reptiles and dinosaurs (with the 
exception of birds, which are feathered dinosaurs). The mass extinctions marked 
the end of the Mesozoic Era and the beginning of the Cenozoic, which continues 
today.
.
The first penguin fossils were uncovered in 1859, and since then more than 50 
species have been identified. The oldest of these, found in New Zealand, date back
about 60 million years. Known as Waimanu, the oldest known penguins lived just a 
few million years after the mass extinctions. The new fossil penguin, Kumimanu, 
was discovered from bones packed in a rock on a New Zealand beach. Realizing that
it was almost as old as Waimanu, Dr. Mayr and his colleagues eagerly studied 
Kumimanu for a better picture of early penguin evolution.
.
To see how it was related to other species, the scientists drew an evolutionary 
tree and found that Kumimanu and Waimanu belonged to its farthest branches. Their
lineages have been extinct for tens of millions of years.
By contrast, all living penguins belong to a young branch of the tree. They share 
a common ancestor that lived only about 15 million years ago. Kumimanu and Waimanu
were already flightless, but they still held onto some primitive traits not found 
in living penguins. ''Their beak looked much more like a stork's,'' Dr. Mayr said.
''Probably they speared their prey.''
.
The early penguin wing was not yet the short, stiff blade found on living
penguins. ''They were probably able to bend it a little farther than penguins can 
today,'' Dr. Mayr said. ''There was more possibility for flexing.''
Where Waimanu and Kumimanu differ from each other is in their height. Waimanu 
stood just two and a half feet high. Kumimanu was more than twice as tall. 
''We already knew penguins were around, and flightless, just a few million years 
after the extinction,'' said Daniel T. Ksepka, a paleontologist at the Bruce 
Museum in Greenwich, Conn., who was not involved in the new study. ''The new 
fossil shows they achieved immense sizes very rapidly as well, which is cool.''
Dr. Mayr speculates that the dramatic origin of penguins was sparked by the mass 
extinctions that marked the dawn of the Cenozoic. Suddenly the oceans were emptied
of many of their biggest predators. Penguins could adapt to catching prey 
underwater without much competition, or fear.
.
''It's an educated guess that makes sense, but there's no rock-solid evidence,'' 
said Dr. Mayr.
One way to test that hypothesis would be to uncover earlier fossils. ''What would 
be cool would be to have a flying ancestor of penguins,'' Dr. Mayr said. The early 
Cenozoic oceans didn't just open up the way for the evolution of flightless 
aquatic birds, Dr. Mayr speculated. It may have also fostered the evolution to big
sizes. Natural selection favors lightweight flying birds because they have to 
work so hard to stay aloft. Penguins don't pay that cost. Getting bigger might 
have brought advantages, as well. A large body makes prey harder to kill.
.
The tree drawn by Dr. Mayr and his colleagues also shows that penguins became 
giants many times over. While Kumimanu belonged to an early lineage of big 
penguins, other lineages produced their own giants as recently as 27 million years
ago. The rise of marine mammals may have doomed giant penguins. As mammals moved 
into the oceans and evolved into whales and seals, they may have outcompeted the 
birds. Both seals and penguins need to find safe beaches where they can mate and 
raise their young, for example. It's possible that the seals pushed the giant 
penguins out, while smaller penguins survived.
.
''The big question for me is not why there were so many penguins in the early 
Cenozoic, but why there are no giant penguins today?'' Dr. Mayr said.

SNOWY OWLS - STEALTHY HUNTERS
.
.
How these birds of prey keep on the move to survive in cold climates
.
The winter wind blows across the open landscape. Short grasses and bushes struggle
to stay upright, but a snowy owl hovers effortlessly in midair a few feet off the 
ground. His powerful, five-foot-long wingspan defies the wind, allowing him to 
hang nearly motionless with his eyes fixed on a small rodent. Then the owl shoots 
forward and extends his sharp talons to grab a rat when, whoosh! Airplane engines 
blast overhead, breaking the owl's concentration and scaring the rat back 
underground.
The young male owl began life in the Arctic about five months ago. This winter he 
flew hundreds of miles south to Logan International Airport near Boston, 
Massachusetts. Perched on a fence at the airport border, he turns his head upside 
down to preen, cleaning his downy coat. His white feathers are tipped with brown 
stripes. When he's mature, he'll be almost all white.
He hears something, spins his head to look behind him, and launches. Like a 
stealth plane, he glides silently for two miles until his keen eyes find his 
target at the water's edge. He maneuvers gracefully, stretches out his talons, and
snatches an unsuspecting duck. Sensitive feet tell him that he killed it on 
impact. Dinner is served.
.
.
Raptors on the Move
.
Snowy owls are nomads that migrate to and from their Arctic breeding grounds each 
spring and fall in a quest for food. Logan Airport is a popular winter destination
for them in the northeastern United States. "The habitat here is like the 
tundra--with short grass and rolling hills," says Norman Smith, a raptor biologist
and director of the Blue Hills Trailside Museum in Milton, Massachusetts. "There 
are lots of rodents, and the airport is surrounded by water so there are ducks and
other waterfowl."
Snowy owls show up at the airport between November and April each year. Smith has 
caught and released about 450 owls at Logan since 1981. He captures the birds in 
a net trap, examines them, and puts a metal band on one leg for future 
identification. Then he releases them away from airplane and car traffic.
Sometimes he equips an owl with an electronic beacon so he can track where the 
bird goes. The beacons help researchers uncover information about where snowy owls
travel when they're not nesting on the Arctic tundra.
.
.
Wintering on Ice
.
Not all snowy owls migrate so far south. Some stay in the Arctic, hunt there, 
and--like one lone female snowy owl--endure the winter in constant darkness. The 
sun never rises in winter this far north. Sea ice covers the landscape, and this 
owl is a hundred miles from land. Temperatures can plummet to minus 40°F, but 
she's not turning into a bird-side. Layers of feathers insulate her, and feathers
cover her nostrils and feet, which are padded for warmth. Her two-foot-tall body 
is motion-less as she conserves energy in the cold. She's hungry; she needs to eat.
A short flight takes the owl to open water, where she swoops down and grabs an 
eider, a northern sea duck. She tears it apart with her beak, unaware that she is 
being monitored. When she was nesting last summer, researchers fit her with a 
birdsize backpack beacon. It sends out a signal with her precise location via 
satellite every five days.
Researchers used to think snowy owls always flew south in the winter, but this 
bird's transmitter has tracked her to the sea ice near Baffin Island in the 
Canadian high Arctic. "It was a big surprise for us to see them staying north," 
says Gilles Gauthier, a professor at Canada's Laval University. "Most of the snowy
owls we tracked spent one to three months on the ice." Gauthier says gaps in the 
ice are where seabirds gather, so hunting is good for a snowy owl.
.
.
Tundra Life
.
As the springtime sea ice thaws, the solitary female snowy owl migrates overland 
to find a good nesting site. She lands on the tundra near Barrow, Alaska, 
satisfied that there is a good supply of lemmings. These rodents are the 
summertime staple of snowy owls. Lots of lemmings mean plenty of food, so snowy
owls will lay many eggs.
By May, the female sits atop a raised mound in the treeless tundra on a nest of
eight eggs, keeping them warm. One by one, fuzzy owlets hatch in mid-June. They
snuggle under their mother's wings and against the featherless brood patch on her 
belly to keep warm in the 40°F weather. Hunting constantly, their father provides 
food for the whole family. The chicks grow quickly, each eating about two lemmings
a day.
Today the male returns to find the female pretending to be injured, trying to lure
away snowy owl researcher Denver Holt, who is examining and banding the chicks. 
The parents think he is a predator. Hooting, the airborne male drops the lemming 
he's carrying, which hits Holt on the head. The owl then rakes his sharp talons 
on Holt's back. The assault continues until Holt leaves. Then the angry birds 
quickly return to being doting parents. "It's pretty intense, but you learn to 
deal with it and duck," Holt says.
When the owlets are about two months old, their fluffy, gray down gives way to 
white-and-brown feathers. They're learning to fly. By October, all of the chicks 
are ready to strike out on their own. Silently, they glide into the darkness to 
their winter destinations.
.
.
BETTER LEFT IN THE WILD
.
On screen, Harry Potter's snowy owl, Hedwig, made a good companion. In real life, 
snowy owls are not good pets. Besides needing a constant supply of whole rodents 
to eat, these hunters require lots of flying space. Experts sometimes have 
permits to keep injured birds in captivity if they'd be unable to survive in the 
wild. Otherwise, it's illegal to keep snowy owls in captivity.

CIVIL RIGHTS
.
.
Summer is finally here! It’s 1961, and your big brother is home from college. But
he’s going to Mississippi to join a group called the Freedom Riders. He explains 
that black and white people have been riding buses together to fight 
discrimination against African Americans. Discrimination is unfair treatment of 
people because of their race, gender, religion, or nationality.
.
More and more African Americans in the 1950s had stood up to this unfair 
treatment. They tried to end segregation, the separation of blacks and whites in 
public places like restaurants. The Freedom Riders and other groups objected to 
segregation laws by using nonviolence, or peaceful protests. But they were still 
attacked sometimes by people who disagreed with them. Martin Luther King Jr. 
became a leader of the civil rights movement. He gave speeches and led peaceful 
marches. In 1963, about 250,000 people came to the nation’s capital for the March 
on Washington. There, King spoke about his dream of the future. He saw a world 
where people wouldn’t be judged by their skin color.
.
In 1951, Linda Brown had playmates of different races in her hometown of Topeka, 
Kansas. She thought she would go to school with all of them. But state law made 
African Americans attend separate schools. The case of Brown v. Board of Education
of Topeka went all the way to the Supreme Court. There, a lawyer named Thurgood 
Marshall argued for integration in public schools. Integration means bringing 
together people of all races. In 1954, the court ruled that schools had to 
desegregate. They had to let kids of all races attend classes together. In 1955,
Rosa Parks took a seat in the middle of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. State law 
said African Americans had to sit in back. When the driver told her to give her 
seat to a white man, she refused—and was arrested. Afterward, Martin Luther King
Jr. led the Montgomery Bus Boycott. For months, black people would not ride city
buses. In 1956, the Supreme Court ruled that public transportation could not be 
segregated.
.
In 1964, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. President Johnson signed it in a 
ceremony shown on TV. This law made segregation illegal in public places. It also 
said employers couldn’t refuse to hire people because of their race, gender, 
nationality, or religion. But even after the law passed, African Americans were 
still treated unfairly. African Americans were kept from voting in some states, 
especially in the South. Martin Luther King Jr. tried to change that in 1965 by 
leading peaceful marches in Selma, Alabama. The marchers were attacked by state 
police and others who disagreed with them. The violence was shown on TV. Many 
people around the nation were upset by it. Later that year, Congress passed the 
Voting Rights Act. By 1968, more than half of all African Americans who were old 
enough had registered to vote.
.
Many groups fought for their rights during the 1960s. Cesar Chavez and Dolores 
Huerta started a group that became the United Farm Workers of America. It tries to
improve conditions for farm laborers. Women fought for equal pay and equal 
rights. Formed in 1966, the National Organization for Women became a political 
force for women’s rights. In 1968, the American Indian Movement (AIM) was founded
to help make life better for Native Americans.
.

.
THE PRESIDENT'S HOME
.
.
The city of Washington, D.C., was created to be the center of the national 
government. A special home, now called the White House, was built for the 
president at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. George Washington chose the spot and 
approved the plans. But he never lived there. The capital city of the U.S. during
his presidency was first New York and then Philadelphia. When the second 
president, John Adams, moved into the presidential home in 1800, it was still 
under construction. Since then, the building has been remodeled, added to, and 
redecorated many times.
.
How did Washington, D.C., become the nation’s capital? The decision to build it 
there was worked out at a dinner between James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and 
Thomas Jefferson. Madison agreed to let the federal government take on the debt 
carried by the states. In return, Hamilton agreed to place the new capital in the
South.
During the War of 1812, the British attacked Washington. They burned the building
where the president lived. At the time, the building was known by various names.
These included the President’s Palace, the Presidential Mansion, the President’s 
House, and even the White House. Before the British arrived, Dolley Madison, wife
of President James Madison, took action. She packed up White House valuables, 
including a famous portrait of George Washington, and got them out of the city. 
After the British were defeated, the house had to be rebuilt. It was repainted 
white to cover the burn marks. President Theodore Roosevelt made the White House
the building’s official name by printing it on his stationery.
.
In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt oversaw construction of the West Wing of the
White House. It contains offices for senior members of the Executive Office. It 
also contains offices for their support staff. The Oval Office (left), the 
president’s office, is in the West Wing. The second and third floors of the White 
House contain private living quarters for the president’s family. There are 
bedrooms, kitchens, sitting rooms, a sun room, and a game room. The private 
quarters also include guest bedrooms. The most famous one is known as the Lincoln 
Bedroom (right). The room was actually used as an office by Abraham Lincoln.
It is now contains a bed that his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, purchased. The bed 
measures almost six feet by eight feet. 
.
The ground floor and first floor of the White House contain rooms for ceremonies.
They are also used for official entertaining. They include the Green Room, Blue 
Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, and East Room. John Adams’s wife, Abigail, 
once had sheets hung up to dry in the East Room. The first lady is the unofficial 
title of the hostess of the White House. A hostess is someone who oversees social 
gatherings. Most often the first lady has been the president’s wife. But if the 
president is a widower or bachelor, a relative or close friend can be the first 
lady. Some first ladies have taken an active role in politics. Eleanor Roosevelt, 
for example, wrote newspaper articles and held press conferences. She traveled 
the country to promote her husband’s New Deal programs. She also supported equal 
treatment for women and people of all races. Other first ladies have supported 
less political causes. First Lady Michelle Obama developed a youth fitness program
called Let’s Move! Her goal is to help end childhood obesity.
.
CHILDREN IN THE WHITE HOUSE
.
Some presidents have had young children who lived in the White House. In 1893, 
Esther Cleveland, the second child of Grover Cleveland, became the only child of a
president to be born there. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest person to become 
president. He brought six children to the White House, ranging in age from 3 to 
17. They were always getting up to something. The nation followed their adventures
with great interest. In 1971, Tricia Nixon became the last president’s child to 
be married in the White House. 
.
.
What Does the President Do?
.
The Constitution describes the job of the president, but the Constitution was 
written more than 200 years ago. As the country has grown and changed, so has the
president’s job. Today, the president has seven major roles.
.
Chief Executive
.
The president is the leader of the executive branch. He appoints the heads of the 
executive branch’s departments and agencies. These include everything from the 
Department of Education to the FBI. The president also makes sure that all laws 
passed by Congress and all court rulings are obeyed. In 1957, local officials in 
Little Rock, Arkansas, ignored a court order. They refused to allow African 
American students to attend Little Rock Senior High School. President Dwight 
Eisenhower then sent in federal troops. They made sure the students could attend 
the school safely.
.
Head of State
.
As the head of state, the president is a symbol of the whole nation. The president 
makes speeches at special occasions and presents awards to outstanding citizens. 
He may even throw out the first ball at the beginning of baseball season – as 
Ronald Reagan is doing here at a Chicago Cubs game in 1988.
.
Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces
.
The president makes decisions about defending the country. He chooses our top 
military leaders. He decides where troops should be sent. He also decides what 
kinds of weapons will be used. Some presidents have sent troops overseas to fight 
even without Congress declaring war. The Korean War (1950–1953) and the Vietnam 
War (1957–1975) are two examples. The president alone decides if nuclear weapons 
will be used. In 1945, President Harry Truman gave the order to drop atomic bombs 
on two Japanese cities in hopes of ending World War II. 
.
Chief Diplomat
.
The president makes decisions about how the nation deals with other countries. 
The president appoints ambassadors. He also sets foreign policy and meets with 
leaders of other countries. Some presidents have taken on the job of peacemaker 
between warring countries. President Jimmy Carter (center) helped Menachem Begin 
of Israel (right) and Anwar Sadat of Egypt (left) reach a peace agreement in 1978.
Begin and Sadat won the Nobel Peace Prize that year. Carter won it in 2002.
.
Legislative Leader
.
Only Congress can pass laws. But the president can send bills to Congress for 
consideration. The Constitution says the president “shall from time to time give 
to the Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their 
consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary.” Over the years, the 
State of the Union speech has become a tradition. The president gives this speech
to Congress every January. In the picture above, John F. Kennedy is delivering 
his first State of the Union speech, in 1961.
.
Party Leader
.
A political party is a group of people who want to direct government policies. 
They do this by electing candidates to office. The U.S. has two major political 
parties: Republican and Democratic. The president is the leader of the party to 
which he or she belongs. The president helps decide the party’s positions on 
issues, and also helps other candidates of the party. The president uses party 
members as advisers and often appoints them to government offices. Above, former 
president Bill Clinton is speaking at the Democratic National Convention in 
Boston, Massachusetts, in 2004.
.
Chief Guardian of the Economy
.
The economy refers to a country’s system of producing, distributing, and consuming
wealth. The president meets with business and labor leaders. He also meets with 
economic advisers. They discuss how to make sure there are enough jobs and how to 
keep prices at an acceptable level. They also discuss whether to raise or lower 
taxes. In general, they discuss how to make sure the country and its people have 
enough money and jobs. In this picture, President Lyndon B. Johnson is visiting 
with a farmer in 1961.

LIFE ON MARS
.
.
Pack your bags, and don't forget the spacesuit--you're moving to Mars! NASA wants 
to send astronauts to Mars by the 2030s. Scientists would live here while 
exploring the planet and finding resources to use back on Earth. And you could be 
one of these planetary pioneers. "Unlike Earth, Mars doesn't have oxygen, water, 
or food," says NASA scientist Chris McKay. "So we'll have to get creative to 
survive." Here's where you might work, sleep, and hang out as a red planet 
resident.
.
.
HOME Base 
.
As your spaceship enters Mars's atmosphere, a pod at the front detaches, springs a
parachute, and floats to the ground with your team inside. The 1,000-square-foot 
gumdrop-shaped pod will be part of your Martian home. You expand the home by going
outside, blowing up a 150-foot-long inflatable tube with an air pump, and 
attaching it to the pod. Your new red planet residence guards you from Mars's cold
temperatures (it's minus 80°F on average!) and dust storms.
.
.
SWEET Digs 
.
Composed of the pod and the inflatable tube, your Martian home boasts showers, a 
kitchen, a living room, a gym, TVs, and even Internet access. The pod from your 
spaceship becomes a huge closet where you hang your spacesuits.
Mars's atmosphere is 95 percent carbon dioxide. So your team must pump oxygen into
your new pad through tanks and hoses. Solar panels generate the energy that powers
your home, and an underground electric heater produces warmth for the dwelling. 
You sleep in a bunker that's extra toasty because of its location next to the 
heater.
.
.
OUT and About 
.
The next groups of colonists set up their homes next to yours to form a tiny 
community on Mars's vast, rocky landscape. Astronauts work together to inflate 
enclosed walkways that connect the dwellings. You reinforce the walkways with 
bricks made of Martian dirt. Now you can move between dwellings without wearing a 
spacesuit.
When you want to explore your new home planet you hop into a rover. The size of 
campers, these vehicles are roomy enough for you and another passenger to live in 
during long explorations.
.
.
WORK Space 
.
Colonists construct a brick building that houses science lab. Here geologists 
analyze soil to hunt for traces of elements that can be used back on Earth as fuel
or material for products. Another building is used as a rover repair center where
people can take broken-down vehicles to be fixed.
.
.
THIRST Quencher 
.
At some point the water sent from Earth will run out. Luckily you have a high-tech
recycling system that cleans used water. The machine takes sweat and, urn, other 
liquids your body produces and turns them into drinking water.
.
.
MARS Menu 
.
The air on Mars is deadly for humans. But plants can tolerate a much higher level 
of carbon dioxide than we can. A greenhouse built by your team protects plants 
from the frigid temperatures and violent dust storms while they soak up some sun. 
Inside, Martian farmers grow fruits and vegetables to eat. A system of tanks 
holds fish brought over from Earth too.
.
.
GETTING THERE 
.
IT'S THE YEAR 2030, but your journey to the red planet started long before 
liftoff. You trained for the mission for several years. During this time you 
learned mechanical skills so you can fix broken equipment as well as first aid 
techniques in case someone gets hurt or sick. Traveling to Mars takes a while too.
The 140-million-mile voyage lasts for six to nine months.
WHO WANTS TO BE A MARTIAN? 
A company called Mars One wants to send 24 people to live on the red planet 
starting in 2026. Many experts doubt Mars One has the technology to get their 
plans off the ground. But that hasn't stopped people from trying to score a spot
on the expedition. Over 4,000 people reportedly applied to join the mission. The
one hundred most qualified candidates will be trained in a model Mars colony. 
They'll have to do tasks such as building Martian dwellings. Those who perform the
best will be selected for the Mars One team.
.
.
.
MISSION TO MARS
.
.
Your guide to living on the red planet.
Congratulations! It's the year 2035, and you've been selected to join NASA's 
newest astronaut class. Your assignment: Travel to Mars. Your crew will be the 
first humans to set foot on the red planet. We're sure you have questions. And we 
have answers. Here's your guide to everything you need to know about surviving 
life on Mars. HOW DO I GET THERE? 
The modern rockets that travel to the International Space Station aren't powerful 
enough to make it 140 million miles to Mars. So NASA is developing a new 
spacecraft called Orion. Orion will be the fastest man-made object ever to blast 
through Earth's atmosphere, reaching a screaming 25,000 miles an hour.
.
At 16 feet across, the craft is about the size of a van. If that sounds cramped, 
don't worry: Scientists are investigating the possibility of hooking up Orion to 
a much bigger ship in space after it's launched from Earth. This ship doesn't 
exist yet; it's just one idea scientists have for a roomier, more comfortable trip
to Mars.
.
.
WHAT DO I WEAR? 
.
"On Mars, your space suit will be the only barrier between you and sudden death," 
says Brad Holschuh, a professor at the University of Minnesota. Besides supplying 
you with oxygen and keeping you warm during Mars's below-freezing nights, your 
space suit protects you from the planet's low pressure. Without the suit, that 
pressure would cause you to lose consciousness and quickly die.
.
Current space suits are like gas-filled balloons that push against the body at the
correct pressure. But the suits are hard to move in--astronauts fall down a lot. 
So Holschuh is part of a team that worked on a new flexible space suit called the 
BioSuit. Astronauts press a button that sends a current through the BioSuit, which
adjusts the suit's smart material to the correct pressure.
.
.
WHAT DO I EAT? 
.
Today's freeze-dried astronaut food is nutritious--but definitely not tasty.
"Astronauts use a lot of hot sauce!" says Trent Smith j of NASA's VEGGIE project, 
I which hopes to amp up ! astronauts' meals of prepackaged mush with fruits and 
vegetables grown in space.
But if an astronaut tried to water crops in zero gravity, the water would just 
float away. So when the VEGGIE scientists launched their galactic garden to the 
International Space Station in 2014, they packed lettuce seeds inside pillows 
filled with fertilizer and a special kind of dirt. Astronauts placed the pillows 
under LED lights and regularly injected them with water, which stuck to the dirt, 
where the growing plants could slurp it up. One month later, the crew harvested 
the first space salad. Mars astronauts could use this technology to grow food in 
their spacecraft on the way to the red planet. Later, they may farm crops in a 
Mars greenhouse.
.
.
HOW DO I GO TO THE BATHROOM? 
.
Mars is drier than Earth's driest desert. So all gadgets on your space base will 
be designed to conserve every drop of water--even from the toilets! The Blue 
Diversion toilets are currently being developed for use in countries where water 
is scarce, but similar technology will likely be used on the red planet too. The 
toilets recycle water, meaning after you've gone to the bathroom, the same water 
from the bowl goes to the sink for you to wash your hands. Sound gross? The toilet
water is first pumped through a filtration system, making it clean enough to 
drink.
.
.
WHAT IF SOMETHING BREAKS? 
.
"When a lightbulb goes out on Earth, you go to the store for a new one," NASA 
planetary scientist Chris McKay says. But on Mars, the store is millions of miles
away. Today's astronauts bring backup parts, but that takes up valuable space. 
Soon astronauts will use 3-D printers--which work by layering materials to build 
an object--to print out whatever they need.
.
.
WHAT IF I GET SICK? 
.
On Mars the nearest doctor is an eight-month flight away. Good thing you'll have 
a digital doc built right into your space suit. Vitaliti is a medical monitor 
prototype being developed for future use. With a piece that wraps around your

HOW DO I GET AROUND? 
.
You'll need to leave your base to explore the red planet. That means taking 
road trips that could last weeks. But the last space vehicle that could carry 
humans, the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle from the 1970s, was a day-tripping buggy 
with space for two astronauts but no long-term supplies. Enter Chariot.
"Chariot is kind of like a space RV," NASA robotics engineer Bill Bluethmann says.
Behind its cockpit, the vehicle has storage space for scientific equipment, 
benches for sleeping, a bathroom, and even a small kitchen.

HOW DO I TALK TO PEOPLE BACK HOME? 
.
When Curiosity--a rover on Mars that's like a science lab on wheels--wants to talk
to Earth, it beams radio waves to one of Earth's three deep-space antennas. But 
the rover sends about 20 photos a day, and communication is limited to text 
messages." When you're on Mars and you want to talk to your family back on Earth, 
texts won't cut it," NASA robotics engineer Chaz Morantz says. Scientists hope to 
speed up communications by using lasers to beam data between Mars and Earth up to 
a hundred times faster. Mars astronauts will be able to send unlimited snaps of 
Martian sunsets, selfies, and even video messages.

YOUR ROBOT SIDEKICKS 
.
Not all jobs are fit for human astronauts. "Anything dull, dirty, or 
dangerous--those are tasks for robots," NASA robotics engineer Maria Bualat says. 
Meet four astrobots in development.

.
LEMUR 
.
Towering cliffs cover Mars's landscape. LEMUR, a robot with claw-studded arms 
inspired by insect limbs, can safely scale dangerous rock faces. It will use a 
camera to get an upclose look at the planet's landmarks and a zero-gravity drill 
to take samples.

.
ASTROBEE 
.
This beach-ball-size flying bot will zoom inside your spacecraft on the journey to
Mars. Astrobee will measure the air to make sure the astronauts have enough 
oxygen, check the spacecraft's parts, and film astronauts as they work so experts 
watching from Earth can offer advice.
.
.
ROBONAUT 
.
When there's important science to do, you won't waste your time fixing broken 
equipment. That's a job for Robonaut. This person-shaped bot will be intelligent 
enough to carry out tasks without a human supervisor.
.
.
RASSOR 
.
Hiding in Mars's dirt are tiny particles of ice. That ice is made of oxygen and 
hydrogen--ingredients needed for rocket fuel. RASSOR will spin its barrel-shaped 
shovels to dig up dirt before carrying i t back to camp for processing.

HOW MANY TURNS FOR THE TERN?
.
.
The world's migration champ sets a new distance record.
Dr. Carsten Egevang gently attaches a small plastic ring to the leg of an Arctic 
tern. The bird kicks in resistance, but Dr. Egevang's assistant keeps it from 
escaping. When the two researchers are done, they release the bird, and it flaps 
to safety with the anklet securely wrapped around its leg.
.
Dr. Egevang is an ornithologist, a scientist who studies birds. Many other 
ornithologists use leg bands to identify birds, but Dr. Egevang's leg bands are 
different. They have tiny electronic devices called geolocators (geo means 
"earth") attached to them. The geolocators, or "loggers," will help Dr. Egevang 
learn where the terns go when they migrate.
.
.
How Far Do They Go?
.
Scientists have known for at least 50 years that Arctic terns migrate farther 
than any other animal. They breed far to the north, in the Arctic. Most of them 
breed in large colonies in Iceland and Greenland. Like many other birds, they 
head south when winter approaches.
Most migrating birds spend the winter near the equator, where temperatures stay 
warm and the birds can find plenty of food to eat. But not Arctic terns. These 
birds fly right over the tropics, all the way to Antarctica-9,000 miles away! (If 
you flew from San Francisco to New York City, you would fly about 2,500 miles.)
Arctic terns spend several months in the Antarctic summer before they fly back to 
the Arctic to breed. That means they migrate 18,000 miles each year, at the very 
least! But they are not likely to fly in straight paths. How far do they actually 
fly?
.
.
Flight Tracking
.
For many years, scientists thought Arctic terns flew about 25,000 miles a year, 
which is equal to a trip around the planet. That estimate included migration plus
flying around in the breeding and wintering grounds. But no one knew for sure. 
What route did they follow? Where did they stop along the way?
Dr. Egevang wanted to find out, and he knew the loggers could help. He bought 50 
loggers and attached them to plastic rings. Then he caught 50 Arctic terns at 
their breeding colonies, fitted each one with a logger, and let them go. As the 
birds flew, the loggers tracked their locations.
But first Dr. Egevang had a long wait. The recorders used in some animal studies 
send data to a computer while the animals are traveling. These devices tend to be 
heavy, since they have to contain fairly big batteries and radio transmitters. But
loggers do not. They must be light enough for a small bird to carry as it flies.
That meant that Dr. Egevang had to remove the loggers from the birds to retrieve 
the data.
.
.
Here, Birdie!
.
One year later, Dr. Egevang returned to the breeding colony to catch the birds 
again. If he didn't find the loggers, he wouldn't get the data. "I worked in a 
colony of approximately 2,000 terns, and it was very challenging to spot the 
small logger attached to the leg of the bird. After spotting the bird in the air, 
we had to find the nest in order to catch it."
When they found the right nest, they put a trap over it. The trap was a small wire
cage propped up at one end by a stick. When the bird returned to the nest and 
settled on the eggs, it also sat on a string that pulled out the stick, trapping 
the bird under the cage.
But the birds had been caught once before, and it wasn't always easy to trap them 
again. Some had gone elsewhere to breed, others did not breed the second year, 
and still others were too sneaky to be caught. Out of 50 banded birds, only 11 
were caught a second time.
.
.
Record-Setting Migration
.
Those 11 loggers held a lot of information. Dr. Egevang was amazed by the 
results. Some birds had flown 50,000 miles in a single year!
Dr. Egevang also solved the mystery of the migration routes. Arctic terns fly 
over the oceans, following the winds to reduce the effort of flying hundreds of 
miles a day. And the birds take longer to fly south than they do to fly north. 
This is probably because they stop to feed for nearly a month in the North 
Atlantic Ocean in early autumn.
Thanks to Dr. Egevang's research, the Arctic tern holds the record for the longest
migration on Earth.

DRESSED FOR THE WEATHER

How changing color helps some Arctic animals survive
You probably dress differently in winter and summer, Some animals do, too. Arctic 
foxes and a few other creatures that are dark in the summertime put on coats of 
white for an entire winter season. This color change in fur or feathers is for 
camouflage--a, white coat conceals both predators and prey in their snowy 
environment.
.
.
FOOD CHAIN
.
When is color camouflage doubly important? When you exist as both predator and 
prey. The coat of an arctic fox changes to white in winter, allowing it to sneak 
up on lemmings, hares, and birds. But when it gets very cold and windy, it becomes
more difficult for foxes to find a meal on their own. They often tag along behind 
a polar bear. hoping to feed on whatever the beat doesn't eat. This survival 
strategy can be risky. Polar bears eat foxes when they can get their paws on them.
Being able to blend into the light, snowy background helps an arctic fox hide.
.
.
DEPENDENT ON DAYLIGHT
.
Foxes change from brown fur to white when the season changes from fall to winter,
and days become shorter. Decreasing daylight triggers these Arctic animals' bodies
to make less of the pigment melanin. Melanin is the substance inside hair OF 
feathers that gives them colon Once a fox stops producing much melanin, its whole
coat is a dazzling white. In the spring the reverse happens. "As the days get 
longer, more melanin is produced and animals convert back to brown," says 
researcher Terri-Lee Reid.
.
An all-white look might work wonders in the middle of winter. But what about when 
the snow starts to melt in spring, leaving large spots of muddy ground all around?
This is where a patchy color scheme comes in handy. Snowshoe hares are well known 
for this kind of camouflage. Their winter hair grows in patches, rather than 
showing up evenly. This adaptation makes it difficult for predators to distinguish
them from a landscape that also looks both brown and white. "In most species that 
turn color it takes two months for the coat to change, whether it is turning white
in the fall or brown in the spring," says biologist Frank Mallory.
.
Collared lemmings are the only rodents with coats that change to a white color. 
They have another interesting adaptation to winter. As snow starts to fall, 
lemmings grow oversize claws on the third and fourth toes of their front feet. 
This allows them to dig tunnels in the snow all winter. Staying below the surface 
helps them avoid predators while they shovel in search of food. By spring, their 
intense burrowing wears down their claws to a normal size again. The arctic fox, 
snowshoe hare, and ptarmigan also have a winter foot adaptation: They develop 
extra fur or feathers on their feet that act as snow shoes. This keeps them from 
falling through the snow as they move around.
The ptarmigan (TAR-mih-guhn) is a bird with feathers that change from brown to 
white, providing camouflage in the snow. Feathers on their legs and feet help keep
the birds warm. Downy feathers close to their skin trap body heat. Just as 
insulation in a house keeps warm air inside during winter, this bird's natural 
insulation makes freezing conditions more bearable. The birds also fly into banks 
of powdery snow, creating little burrows that are warmer than outside 
temperatures.
.
Some animals don't turn completely white, even in the heart of winter. The ermine 
is one of them. This weasel wears black on the very tip of its tail year-round. 
Why? This black blotch is a valuable decoy during attacks by flying predators. 
Studies have shown that hungry hawks have a harder time catching an ermine with a 
black tip on its tail than they do seizing a weasel that is completely white. When
hawks swoop down to attack, the black tip confuses them. They see the ermine 
moving one way, and its tail flailing about behind it in other directions. This 
blur of motion can cause a hawk to miss the ermine entirely. Even when a hawk 
makes a more successful strike, it often grasps the ermine's tail rather than its 
body. That gives the ermine a fighting chance to squirm away.
